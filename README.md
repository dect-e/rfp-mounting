Mounting plates for Mitel RFPs
==============================

This repository contains two directories:

- `dimensions` contains drawings and measurements of the RFPs' mounting holes
- `things` adapts those measurements into mounting plate designs, ready to be
  laser-cut or 3D-printed

Currently, we only have measurements and designs for the 2nd/3rd generation
indoor RFPs (RFP 32, 42, 35, and 43), which all use the same plastic case.  
1st and 4th generation, as well as outdoor, RFPs have a different form factor,
so would require a completely different mounting plate design.

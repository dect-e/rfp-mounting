Mitel RFP43 mounting plate
==========================

The files in this directory contain a mounting plate designed for the two
mounting holes on the back of an RFP43. All 2nd/3rd gen indoor RFPs will have
virtually identical holes.

The dxf file can be directly used as input for a laser cutter.

We have verified the correct placement of the mounting holes (**note: this revision still has a small offset; this will be corrected later!**)
with a proof-of-concept cut on 5 mm wood composite board.

For real-world usage, we plan to use acrylic glass to make the plate
splinter-free and more resistant against gaffer tape.  
We anticipate that 4 mm acrylic glass should provide sufficient strength
(especially for tight ziptie mounting).

Features
--------

- 2 holes for M4 screws to hook the RFP onto.
- 3 holes for 5mm-headed nails to latch into the RFP's "feet" (to prevent it
  from accidentally slipping off the hooking screws).  
  The 2 + 1 holes are placed such that the RFP can be latched both
  ethernet port up and ethernet port down.
- 3 triangular holes (protruding above the RFP case) to hang the plate onto
  wall screws/hooks.
- 2 holes near the top through which a hanging wire loop can be fed.
- A variety of slots for zip-tying the plate to a pole (vertical or
  horizontal), grate, fence, or similar.
- 5 cm clearance from both the top and bottom of the plate to the nearest RFP
  case protrusion, to allow the plate to be gaffer-taped to a surface before
  hooking in the RFP (and not having the tape obstruct any of the RFP's
  mounting points).

Suggested material
------------------

- Wood or acrylic glass plate (approx. 4 mm thickness should be ideal)
- 2 × M4 8 mm screws (to hook the RFP onto)
- (optionally:) 3 × nails, 4 mm or 5 mm head diameter, min. 4 mm length (to
  latch the RFP in place)

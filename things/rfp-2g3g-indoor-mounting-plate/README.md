Mitel RFP43 mounting plate
==========================

The files in this directory contain a mounting plate designed for the two
mounting holes on the back of an RFP43. All 2nd/3rd gen indoor RFPs will have
virtually identical holes.

The dxf file can be directly used as input for a laser cutter.

We have verified the correct placement of the mounting holes
with a proof-of-concept cut on 5 mm wood composite board.

For real-world usage, we plan to use acrylic glass to make the plate
splinter-free and more resistant against gaffer tape.  
We anticipate that 4 mm acrylic glass should provide sufficient strength
(especially for tight ziptie mounting).

Features
--------

- 2 holes for M4 screws to hook the RFP onto.
- 3 holes for 5mm-headed nails to latch into the RFP's "feet" (to prevent it
  from accidentally slipping off the hooking screws).  
  The 2 + 1 holes are placed such that the RFP can be latched both
  ethernet port up and ethernet port down.
- 3 triangular holes (protruding above the RFP case) to hang the plate onto
  wall screws/hooks.
- 2 holes near the top through which a hanging wire loop can be fed.
- A variety of slots for zip-tying the plate to a pole (vertical or
  horizontal), grate, fence, or similar.
- 5 cm clearance from both the top and bottom of the plate to the nearest RFP
  case protrusion, to allow the plate to be gaffer-taped to a surface before
  hooking in the RFP (and not having the tape obstruct any of the RFP's
  mounting points).

Suggested material
------------------

- Wood or acrylic glass plate (approx. 4 mm thickness should be ideal)
- 2 × M4 8 mm screws (to hook the RFP onto)
- (optionally:) 3 × nails, 4 mm or 5 mm head diameter, min. 4 mm length (to
  latch the RFP in place)

Files
-----

- The svg file serves as the source of information; it contains separate
  layers, so the RFP's holes, ziptie slots, and hanging holes can all be
  hidden/shown individually.
- The dxf file has been exported from the svg and is ready to be laser-cut.
- The "dimension" files are identical to the main dxf, but contain measurement
  markings (measured on the drawing, which is in turn based on actual physical
  measurements). Do not use it for laser cutting, unless you want an art piece
  with lasered-in measurement numbers. ;)

All measurements are in millimeters, usually with a resolution and accuracy of
approx. 0.1 mm.

Mitel RFP43 mounting holes
==========================

The files in this directory contain the dimensions of the two mounting holes on
the back of an RFP43. All 2nd/3rd gen indoor RFPs will have virtually identical
holes.

For mounting, you can hook the RFP onto an M4 screw.  
M5 also fits into the mounting hole, but will usually have a bigger screw head
that only fits into the insertion slot if you tilt/wiggle the RFP
forwards/backwards.

The screw should protrude approx. 4 mm (not including the head) from your
mounting plate.
